Facebook Profiles Picture - it's a very simple tool till now all it does for now is fetching pictures from Facebook profiles and store it inside a folder.

What is my vision?
===================

My vision is to make image reverse search tool for Facebook profiles pictures.

What is the advantages of this tool?
=====================================

It might used for predicting things in some countries, or to count something.

How many people are using a specific political sign?

like in Egypt a lot of people putting Rabia sign as a profile picture.

How many people are supporting certain political figure ?

How many people are putting Morsi's or El-Sisi's pictures in their profiles?

Maybe

How many people are putting black color pictures?

or it might in some countries they like a specific color.

Maybe some events makes people changes their profiles pictures to a specific picture supporting Gaza like what happened between Gaza and Israel.

There are alot of possibilities to use this idea in useful things in social media and other fields.
