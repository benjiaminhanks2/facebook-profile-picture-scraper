*Now I am using phasher class, Perceptual hashing is a method to generate a hash of an image which allows multiple images to be compared by an index of similarity.

What is my vision?
===================

*My vision is to make image reverse search tool for Facebook profiles pictures.

What is the advantages of this tool?
=====================================

*It might used for predicting things in some countries, or to count something.

-How many people are using a specific political sign?

*Like in Egypt a lot of people putting Rabia sign as a profile picture.

-How many people are supporting certain political figure ?

-How many people are putting Morsi's or El-Sisi's pictures in their profiles?

-How many people are putting black color pictures?

*Or it might in some countries they like a specific color.

*Maybe some events makes people changes their profiles pictures to a specific picture supporting Gaza like what happened between Gaza and Israel.

*There are alot of possibilities to use this idea in useful things in social media and other fields.
