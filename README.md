*Now I am using phasher class, Perceptual hashing is a method to generate a hash of an image which allows multiple images to be compared by an index of similarity.

What is my vision?
===================

*My vision is to make image reverse search tool for Facebook profiles pictures.

What is the advantages of this tool?
=====================================

*It might used for predicting things in some countries, or to count something likr:

-How many people are supporting certain political figure?

-Maybe some events makes people change their profile picture to a specific picture supporting that event.

*There are alot of possibilities to use this idea in useful things in social media and other fields.
